# A simple build script for VMware Fusion 7

<small>This is only tested in BASH (4.3.33) on OSX (10.10.3)</small>

There are some steps that needs to be taken before this will work:

* Have Windows (?) on a virtual vmware machine
    - I'm running windows 8.1
* You need to be a local administrator
* Have Visual Studio
* Have a shared folder between your MAC and Windows machine (share your Documents folder)
* Set up your site with IIS


This should be all


You should start your virutal machine with the [vmware-control script](https://github.com/ctwise/alfred-workflows#vmware-control) for [alfred](http://www.alfredapp.com/), that's how I do it. By using that script, your virtual machine starts in a non GUI mode.

TODO: I should make this work with alfred, but this was the fastest way to get it all working
