# A simple build script for VMware Fusion 7

<small>This is only tested in BASH (4.3.33) on OSX (10.10.3)</small>

There are some steps that needs to be taken before this will work:

* Have Windows (?) on a virtual vmware machine
    - I'm running windows 8.1
* You need to be a local administrator
* Have Visual Studio
* Have a shared folder between your MAC and Windows machine (share your Documents folder)
* Set up your site with IIS


This should be all
